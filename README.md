# repo-viewer_MobileApp_react-Native
This is a simple React Native application that allows you to view GitHub repositories and their commits. It fetches repositories from the GitHub API and displays them in a list. You can search for repositories by name or description, and view the details of a selected repository, including its owner, description, and the last 10 commits.
